                    cuisine.Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be
                    added. </p>

                <h2>Steaks</h2>
                <p>By definition, steak is “a slice of meat cut from the fleshy part of a beef carcass.” While there are
                    meat chops that cook like steaks and even veggies that can be sliced into “steaks”.</p>

                <h2>Panzanella</h2>
                <p>"It seems like an easy dish, but can be disappointing and soggy if not balanced. Proper texture and
                    flavor starts with a juicy ripe tomato, cucumber, beautiful basil, thin onion and sweet olive."</p>
